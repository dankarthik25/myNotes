* ORG-MODE
For more info visit https://orgmode.org/org.html
** Introduction
Origally meant for orgranize  create todo list, schedule, doc,latex,ppt,
People use emacs only because of org mode

Most important is we can Emacs Configuration file by Org-mode 

We can export to html,pdf,latex,ppt....etc

This tutorial we will Configure .emacs file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

We can write many lang like c,c++,python,shell,lisp,emac-lisp

What great about emacs-lisp is when we launch emacs all " emacs-lisp code" in ORG File is extrated in other file and this file is executed by Init file (.emacs)

To create call all function in  Init file we use a function called org-babel

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/myconfig.org"))
#+END_SRC

       | cmd   | ORG function                    |
       | <s    | Create the block to insert code |
       | C-c ' |  open window to insert code     |
       |       |                                 |
       |       |                                 |

what happen if expot it ?
** View image in org
Add the following code to my init.el file:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(setq org-image-actual-width nil)
#+END_SRC


Then insert this code in my document, where I want the image to appear:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300
[[./my_image.jpg]]
# [C-c C-x C-v] to toggle image
#+END_SRC


On executing org-toggle-inline-images the image appears in the buffer, 300px wide, as expected.


#+ATTR_ORG: : width 10
