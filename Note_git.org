* git
** What is git
- git is free and opensouce VCS (Version Control System) created by linux torvaldss in 2005. Version Control System  mean which is used to track all change in project
- Using git
  -  No data is lost and undo previous data using his
  -  all users can access and share the project
  -  security: outsiders can access and edit the project
  -  git has (distributed repo )

*** TODO Q) git Vs SVN (Subversion)
SVN is centralised VCS , Git is distributed VCS
SVN is still used because of its performance with large files won't be satisfied with Git.
** short tutorial
- Creating a version control of local repository
  - We need to Create a version contol file (=.git=) it create by =git init=
    
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git init                                  # Inicialize or Create a version control 
     git status                                # View the Stagging Area
     git add <file>                            # Add files to stagging Area
     git add -A
     git rim --cached <file>                   # Remove files in Stagging Area
     touch .gitignore                          #  list all files  that are need to ignore                    # Ignore files in Stagging Area
     git commit -m "fist commit"               # Save-Commit  to Local Repo
     git remote add orgin https://github.com/....                      # Connect Local Repo to Remote Repo
     git push origin master                    # Upload Local Repo to Remote Repo
     git pull                                  # Update Local Repo
     git clone https://github.com/..git        # clone to current dir   # Clone
     git diff  <commit id> <commit id>         # diff : View changes in fiels

     ## Creat Branch ,push, delete:
     git branch <branch-name>       # create a new branch
     git chechout -b <branchname>    # to create and moveing to the   
     git branch                      # list of branch
     git branch --list               # list of branch
     git checkout UncleDaveEmacs     # Switch one branch to other
     git push -u origin UncleDavesEmacs  # push branch from local repo to remote repo
     git branch -D UncleDaveEmacs  # delete a branch
     git push orign <branch-name>     # push branch to remote repo
     git branch -D devop     # git delete a branch in local repository
     git push origin --delete <branch name>     # delete branch at remote repositort
     git push origin --delete UncleDaveEmacs # delete a branch in remote repository

     # Merge
     git chekout master # to go to destination (master)
     git merge <branch-name>     # merge brach to master git
#+END_SRC
** Installation and Configuration Cmd
#+BEGIN_SRC  sh
  git --version   # >> git version 2.3.2

  # Configuration 
  git config --global user.name "Dankarthik25"

** TODO Q)three main states in git 
- Git has three main states that your files can reside in:
  - Working-Dir, Stagging Area, Local repo, Remote repo 
  - =Working-Dir=      File but have not have =Version Control= (committed)
  - =Stagging Area=    Marked a modified file  which are to be commit
  - =Committed=      Current files are commented/safed in local Repository =.git directory=.
  - =Remote Repository=
*** How to Commit files ? 
**** initialize  the file or local-repository  (git init):()
Create a version control folder or =initialize= or track (changes or versions) we have to initialize the folder 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# go the directory (Local-Repositore) that has to be version control 
git init
#+END_SRC

This will create a =.git= file in the current directory  which consist of all the change that are to be done
**** Adding files to git (git add file)
files which are uncommited are changed to =staged= 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git add <file>             # add files to git
git add -A                     # add all file
git status                     # show <file> or all file are change to commited area
#+END_SRC
***** Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git add .gitignore
git add .emacs
git add .vimrc
#+END_SRC
 =.gitignore=  which was in untracked () is changed to staging area or committed
**** Removing files from git (git reset file)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git reset <file>                     # remove  files from stating area( committed)
git reset                                  # remove all files
#+END_SRC
**** .gitignore
hidden file =.gitignore=  contain the list of the all the file and folder that ignore by git for version control
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
touch .gitignore
ls -a >> .gitigonre	# and remove the files need to be VC
#+END_SRC
***** Example
in file add the file or folders that are to ignored by git
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# file that are to ignore
.DS_Store
.project
*.pyc
#+END_SRC
**** Commit files (git commit)
Note : All files are need to to add/ignored then only we can commit files
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Initial Commit"                        # file are commited 
  git status                                                                  # show nothing to commit , working directoru clean    
#+END_SRC
*** Connect Local Repository to Remote Repository
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
git remote add origin url    # eg: git remote add origin https://github.com/dankarthik25/pythonUdemyTutorial  
  #+END_SRC
*** Push Local Repository to Remote Repository (git push)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git push origin master
# git push origin master -f     # Force if cmd not works
#+END_SRC
*** TODO Pull Remote Repository to Local Repository
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git pull
#+END_SRC
** Clonning a repository
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone <url> <path- which dir>
git clone ../remote_repo.git .
git clone <url> .                        # . means current direcory
#+END_SRC

** Q)Pull vs fetch
- In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.
- git fetch
  - Update your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/.
  - No change in local repo/branch,Staging Area, Working Dir.
- git pull
  - Update your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/.
  - Change local branch and Working Dir
    - Note: All the Untracked data will be lost in Working Dir
    - Note: merge only current branch wich it is pulled
      
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# fetch hold data(fetch data from remote  repository to local repository)  r  but not merges with current reposiotory
git fetch
git merge # it merges local repository to current repository 

# pull
git pull origin <branch-name> # git fetch and git merge
#+END_SRC

** Creating a Branch (git branch <branch-name>)
source : https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ## Creat Branch ,push, delete:
    git branch <branch-name>                  # create a new branch
    git branch UncleDaveEmacs       # Create a branch
    git branch                      # list of branch
    git branch --list               # list of branch
    git checkout UncleDaveEmacs     # Switch one branch to other
    git chechout -b <branchname>    # to create and moveing to the <branch-name>
    git push -u origin UncleDavesEmacs  # push branch from local repo to remote repo
    git branch -D UncleDaveEmacs  # delete a branch
    git push orign <branch-name>     # push branch to remote repo
    git branch -D devop     # git delete a branch in local repository
    git push origin --delete <branch name>     # delete branch at remote repositort
    git push origin --delete UncleDaveEmacs # delete a branch in remote repository
#+END_SRC
** log
Consist of < commit id, Author, Date, Comment on commit > 
 mode on your branch
#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
git log  # give <git id,author, date, commit message>
git log --online # give short version only < commit id, comment- message >

#+END_SRC

** reset vs revert
*** Git reset
The git reset command allows you to RESET your current head to a specified state. You can reset the state of specific files as well as an entire branch. This is useful if you haven't pushed your commit up to GitHub or another remote repository yet.
*** Three types of reset 
  |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Type of reset | Description                                                          |
  |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | soft          | keep all changes in stagging area, remove from local repo            |
  | mixed         | keep all changes in workind dir, remove from stagging and local repo |
  | hard          | removes all changes from local repo,stagging and local repo          |
  |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 
- In the simplest terms:
  
| Type of reset | Workdir          | Stagging Area          | Local Repo | git log | Remote Repo |
|---------------+------------------+------------------------+------------+---------+-------------|
| soft          | Prescent         | moved to Stagging Area | Removed    | Removed | Prescent    |
| mixed         | Moved to Workdir | Removed                | Removed    | Removed | Prescent    |
| hard          | Removed          | Removed                | Removed    | Removed | Prescent    |
|---------------+------------------+------------------------+------------+---------+-------------|

*** TODO revert (Need to check if revert altering history of commits)
Both the git revert and git reset commands undo previous commits. But if you've already pushed your commit to a remote repository, it is recommended that you do not use git reset since it rewrites the history of commits. This can make working on a repository with other developers and maintaining a consistent history of commits very difficult.

Instead, it is better to use git revert, which undoes the changes made by a previous commit by creating an entirely new commit, all without altering the history of commits.


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # delete file in local and remote repo

  # To remove file for remote to  
  git revert <commitid> 
  git commit - m "remove from remote"

  got log --oneline

  #commit id : 1
  #commit id : 2
  #commit id : 3
  #commit id : 4
  #commit id : 5
  git reset --soft 2 # keep the commit after 2 (3,4,5) 
  #commit id : 3
  #commit id : 4
  #commit id : 5


  git reset --hard 77592f3  # 
  git reset --soft 77592f3  # local repo to stagging 
  git reset --mixed 77592f3 #  local repo to work - dir

  git log --oneline
  # beef857 Revert "created test3 file"
  # 77592f3 created test3 file

  # 78b777d created test1 file
  # a7968c1 Created hh
  # 4b30445 Created bb
  # 2e435ca Created gg file to intall git

  git revert 1c08f78
  git push origin master
#+END_SRC
** Git branching Modeling
 If your team is doing continuous delivery then it is suggested to follow Git branch model. Here is a simple version of it
https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

At the core, the development model is greatly inspired by existing models out there. The central repo holds two main branches(master(origin) , developer)
with an *infinite lifetime*:
- master :
  We consider origin/master to be the main branch 
- develop:
  When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged back into master somehow and then tagged with a release number.

  Therefore, each time when changes are merged back into master, this is a new production release by definition. We tend to be very strict at this, so that theoretically, we could use a Git hook script to automatically build and roll-out our software to our production servers everytime there was a commit on master

  Any feature branch from develop Must merge back into develop. feature branches are limited time branch which will eventually merged back to develop branch
   
- Supporting branches:
  Development model uses a variety of supporting branches to aid
  - parallel development between team members,
  - ease tracking of features,
  - prepare for production releases and to
  - assist in quickly (bug)fixing live production problems.
    
  Unlike the main branches, these branches always have a *limited life time*, since they will be removed eventually.

The different types of branches we may use are:
  - feature
    Any feature branch from develop Must merge back into develop. feature branches are limited time branch which will eventually merged back to develop branch 

    naming convention:anything except master, develop, release-*, or hotfix-*
     
    Feature branches (topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.
    When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).
    
  - release branch
    Any Release branches from develop and Must merge back into develop and master. naming convention(release-*)
    - Release branches support preparation of a new production release.
    - Allow for minor bug fixes and
    - preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.).
      
    By doing all of this work on a release branch, the develop branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.

    The key moment off a new release branch when
    - atleast all features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time.
    - All features targeted at future releases may not—they must wait until after the release branch is branched off.
      
  - hotfix(BUG-fix)
    Any hotfix branch from master Must merge back into develop and master
    naming convention:hotfix-* 

    They arise from the necessity to
     - act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version.
     - When a critical bug in a production version must be resolved immediately, a hotfix branch may be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

     The essence is that team members (on the develop branch) can continue, while another person is preparing a quick production fix.
     
** merge
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout master # to git <branch-name>
git merge devop # git merge <other-branch-name>

##  Example 

# create nn file in "devop"  branch
git checkout devop
touch nn
git add .
git commit -m "created nn file"
git push  origin devop

# merge "devop" branch to  "master branch"
git chekchout master

#+END_SRC
** TODO merge vs rebase vs cherrypick
git merge :
- Is a non-destructive operations
- Existing branes are not change in any way
- Create new <commit-id> in original(main) branch
- Normal merge changes history and squash merge will not change history all original but new commit-id is created .

git rebase:
- Moves the entire 2nd branch to main branch
- Re-writes the project history
- We get much cleaner and linear project
    
git cherry-pick:
- Add specific <commit -id>  to 1st branch 
- For cherry-pick add particular <commit -id>
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout master
touch aaa
git add aaa
git commit -m "created aaa file in master"

git checkhout -b "release-1.0"
git rebase master
#+END_SRC

*** cheery pik
Not all commit id in branch are merged in main branch
but selected commit id are merged in main branch

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout -b future
touch ww
git add .
git commit -m "create ww file"
touch ww

touch www
git add .
git commit - m "create www file"


touch wwww
git add
git commit - m "create wwww file"

touch wwwww | git add .
git commit -m "create wwwww file"

git log --online 
# c459d7a created wwwwww file
# b866590 created wwwww file
# b510fa6 created www file
# b6b5153 created ww file
# 9d75eb8 created aaa file in master
# 7fb9174 created file called mm

# Q) merge only www file from future brach to master
git log --online # to get the <commit -id> of www file : b877590

git checkout master

git cherry-pick b877590
git log --online 
# b866590 created wwwww file
# 9d75eb8 created aaa file in master
# 7fb9174 created file called mm

#+END_SRC
** conflicts
When two branch <kar> <sanjay> make different change in a same file 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout master
vi ww
# hello

git add  .
git commit -m "modified ww file"

git log 

git checkout future

** Interview Qusestion
- Q)If branch and merge, and pull and push  are done my devops then what is role of devops 
- Ans) devops role is to create hotfix branch and and set a maile to devops  
*** what is use of git 
- to  track all changes in file or directory in VCS [Version Control System]
- can not lose data -delete -revert
- all users can access and send data
*** Different type of vcs
- cenrtal vcs svn
- distributed vs : github or bitbucket
