* Vagrant
** Vagrant Virtualization (Creating virtual meachine Environment)
*** Introduction Why Virtualization 
**** Why use the Virtualization (Linux installallation) in class ?
- No suprises which lets you to stay  focused on scripting
- Allow you to get the best help possible(in class all students has same os)
- Quickly crete multiple Linux system
**** What is Virtualization Software 
- Allow to RUN Linux inside virtual machine(eg: VirtualBox(oracle) )
- Free to download and easy to install
- Run on winodws,mac,linux 
- Provides full virtualization are know as Virtual Box(). 
- Pyhsical computer = host.
- Virtual Computer = guest
- Guest OS think it's runing on real hardware but it is actually running on host Os
**** Why Vagrant
- In VirtualBox we can manually create a virtual os, but it is difficult to replicate the os(type, config,share sys setting) to other computers. So Vagrant provieds it
- Virtual Box is time consuming , not automate it
- Easy to configure , reproduce environments
***** Pros and Cons of Vagrant
- Pros
  - Free
  - Automation of virtual machine management tasks
  - Easy to use commands
  - Easy to Configure of OS, Share Configuration of Os  
  - Local testing
  - Well Documented
  - Vagrant is decentralized so anyone can make a container package to get a project started. you aren't limited to wordpress, or even one style of wordpress install (you can make a sage.io wordpress environment).
  - Vagrant easily lets you set ports and URLs for local development.
- Cons
  - Can be difficult to set up(setup in cmd ) Lacks a GUI
  - Uses lots of resources on old machines
  - Compatibility issues with some operating systems (Windows 8.1 home, Windows 10 home)
  - Can take up a lot of disk space if running several VMs with various configurations
**** Vagrant Boxes 
Box = Operating System Image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# vargrant box add <USER>/<BOX> # USER : user name of os, BOX : Iso image of OS
# Eg:
vargrant box add jasonc/centos7
#+END_SRC
**** Create Vagrant Projects
To Create a Vagrant Project :
- Create and Open a Folder
- Inicialize Vagrant Project
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir VagrantProject1
cd VagrantProject1
vagrant init jasonc/centos7 
vagrant up
#+END_SRC

**** Start Virtual machine in Vagrant Project 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant up # Vagrant will import box into Virtual Box and start it.

#+END_SRC
**** Vagrant Up/ multi-machine
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#Synatx:
#       vagrant up <Vm_Name>
vagrant up master
vagrant up server1
vagrant up          # start all virtual machines 
#+END_SRC
*** SSH-Secure Shell
**** Introduction
SSH : Secure Shell
Cryptographic Network Protocol
Uses for acessing remote servers
SSH uses Asysmmetric Cipers
In cryptograph,cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption and decryption
- Why we need ssh
  - Username and password can be stolen in middle but ssh ensure no 3rd party know username and password

- SSH create public key and a private pair
  - private key is not share to any one
  - public key is shared to any one

- There are many encryption methods like (rsa, dsa, ed25519...etc)

Cons in SSH:
 - Since it's a service, so its not available until system starts
 - If by mistake (forgot or deleted private key)  then you can't log back in

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtuAdk4MwWw : Dynamic ssh, reverser ssh, ssh tunneling

Network protacol used to connect to Linux
No built-in SSH client
Git include as SSH client
**** SSH in Vagrant
Vagrant provide simple shortcut to ssh into the meachine
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant ssh <Vm-name> # Vm-name :to ssh into Project name
exit # to end ssh connection
# log out of the Linux system by running the "exit" command.
#+END_SRC

**** Vagrant Halt,Suspent,Resume,Destroy
Vagrant it can use to control the Vm   like halt
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant halt <vm-name> # halt <vm-name>
vagrant halt           # halt all virtual machines 
# you will not lose any work youâ€™ve performed on the virtual machine.  The virtual machine will still exist in VirtualBox, it will simply be stopped.
vagrant up <vm-name> # start and
vagrant suspend <vm-name>  # to suspend
vagrant resume <vm-name>   # to resume 
vagrant destroy <vm-name>  # to remove virtual-meachine from virtual box
# you want to start over with a fresh copy of the virtual machine, run "vagrant destroy" all work inside virtual-meachine will be lost.
vagrant # help
#+END_SRC 
**** Vagrantfile[in Project file]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.box = "jasonc/centos7"  #Operating System like Ubuntu-64, Centos,...etc
   config.vm.network "private_network", ip "10.2.3.4" # How your host see your box : configure ip address...etc
   config.vm.provision "shell",path ="setup.sh" # what we want setup # lamp stack, mean stack,Nodejs
   config.vm.synced_folder # How you access file in your computer : edit files using atom, vs code.....etc
   config.vm.provider # Virtualbox like hyperV, VmWare
end
#+END_SRC

**** Example fo vagrant file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
      config.vm.box = "jasonc/centos7"
      config.vm.define "test1" do |test1|
        test1.vm.hostname = "test1"
        test1.vm.network "private_network", ip: "10.9.8.5"
      end
      config.vm.define "test2" do |test2|
        test2.vm.hostname = "test2"
        test2.vm.network "private_network", ip: "10.9.8.6"
      end
    end

#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
# config.vm.box = "jasonc/centos7"
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
#+END_SRC
**** Vagrantfile
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# vi Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure(2) do | config | 
     config.vm.box= "jasonc/centos7"
     config.vm.hostname = "linuxsvrl"
     config.vm.network "private_network", ip :"10.2.3.4"
     config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
       vb.gui = true
       vb.memory = "1024"
     end    
     config.vm.provision "shell", path : "setup.sh"
end
#+END_SRC
*** Config vagrant file for multi-virtual machine project
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant box add jasonc/centos7   # img is load in os
cd /Workspace/Shell/shellclass
mkdir multitest
cd multitest
vagrant init jasonc/centos7
# edit vagrantfile 
vi vagrantfile                 # inside vagrantfiel
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
   config.vm.box = "jasonc/centos7"  

   config.vm.define "test1" do |test1|
       test1.vm.hostname = "test1"
       test1.vm.network "private_network", ip "10.9.8.5" # How your host see your
   end 

   config.vm.define "test2" do |test2|
       test1.vm.hostname = "test2"
       test1.vm.network "private_network", ip "10.9.8.6" # How your host see your
   end 
end


# in terminal in /Workspaec/Shell/shellcalss/multitest
vagrant up   # up every meachines test1,test2
vagrant status # show 2 running virtualbox
vagrant ssh test1
exit 
vagrant ssh test2
ping -c 3 10.9.8.6 # ip address of test2 system
#+END_SRC

*** Excersise 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd /Workspace/Linux_script/udemy_shellclass/
cd localuser
# pwd Workspace/Linux_script/udemy_shellclass/
vagrant init jasonc/centos7
vagrant up
vagrant status
vagrant ssh
# root
# |- Vagrant  (home directory)
#    |- Vagrantfile(config)
#+END_SRC
** Creating User Account in Vagrant 
*** Introduction 
- Your First Script
 - Create new account 
 - Checks for proper privileges 
 - Reports if account creation failed
- But 1st need to Learn all *Concepts and Techinques*
 - project based learing helps you learn and retain new material
 - You'll use what you learn in the appropiate context
- Net 4 Lesson consist of demonstration and teaching
  - You can watch or follow along
  - All scripts are in course download
- Practice Your Skills in Exercise
 - Follow instruction for exercise
 - You'll write the script and test it.
 - Watch the instruction implement  script

*** Creating
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# man useradd  
# useradd [options] LOGIN : Login are username , there should be 8 char or less it's general  practice, but it can more tha 8-char eg: ps -ef
# usernaem is case sensetive, No special chara

sudo useradd dougstamper   # create user : dougstamper
passwd # set passwd for  dougstamper


#+END_SRC
