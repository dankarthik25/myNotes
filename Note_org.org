People use emacs only because of org mode

Most important is we can Emacs Configuration file by Org-moDifference in Reference variable and pointer variable
References are generally implemented using pointers. A reference is same object, just with a different name and reference must refer to an object. Since references can’t be NULL, they are safer to use.

A pointer can be re-assigned while reference cannot, and must be assigned at initialization only.
Pointer can be assigned NULL directly, whereas reference cannot.
Pointers can iterate over an array, we can use ++ to go to the next item that a pointer is pointing to.
A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address. A reference has the same memory address as the item it references.
A pointer to a class/struct uses ‘->'(arrow operator) to access it’s members whereas a reference uses a ‘.'(dot operator)
A pointer needs to be dereferenced with * to access the memory location it points to, whereas a reference can be used directly.de 

We can export to html,pdf,latex,ppt....etc

This tutorial we will Configure .emacs file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

We can write many lang like c,c++,python,shell,lisp,emac-lisp

What great about emacs-lisp is when we launch emacs all " emacs-lisp code" in ORG File is extrated in other file and this file is executed by Init file (.emacs)

To create call all function in  Init file we use a function called org-babel

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/myconfig.org"))
#+END_SRC

       | cmd   | ORG function                    |
       | <s    | Create the block to insert code |
       | C-c ' |  open window to insert code     |
       |       |                                 |
       |       |                                 |

C-C A      – AGENDA
C-C [      – ADD DOCUMENT TO THE LIST OF AGENDA FILES
C-C ]      – REMOVE DOCUMENT FROM THE LIST OF AGENDA FILES
C-C .      – ADD DATE
C-U C-C .  – ADD TIME AND DATE
C-G        – STOP DOING WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, ESCAPE


IF SCREEN SPLIT THEN DO C-C 0

** DATE AND TIME (NO TIME ZONE)
C-C .          – ADD DATE<2018-08-07 Tue>
S-<UP/DOWN>    - CHANGE + OR -   
C-U C-C . – ADD TIME AND DATE

what happen if expot it ?
** View image in org
Add the following code to my init.el file:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(setq org-image-actual-width nil)
#+END_SRC


Then insert this code in my document, where I want the image to appear:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300
[[./my_image.jpg]]
# [C-c C-x C-v] to toggle image
#+END_SRC


On executing org-toggle-inline-images the image appears in the buffer, 300px wide, as expected.


#+ATTR_ORG: : width 10
[[~/mynotes/MTechCard.jpg]]
** Write Source Code, Quotes, Examples :
*** Source Code (<s ,<se, <ss )
Babble is a subtool used to insert code (c,c++,py,shell,lisp,elisp...etc)
Eg:
shortcut : " <s TAB  "
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :export 
echo "Hello world" # C-c C-c to run the code in the brackests
#+END_SRC

Note : org-bable package is required to run the code in org-mod
*** To run the code in Block (C-c C-c)
m nn
move the cursor to the +begin line and press C-c C-c 
*** Quote (<q)
short cut : " 
<q TAB "

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Do me the favor, do me the biggest favor, matter of fact do yourself the biggest favor and integrate those into your workflow.
#+END_QUOTE
*** Example (<e)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ASFDASDFDSAFSFDSDFASDF
ASDADFSFAD Sasdfasdf
#+END_EXAMPLE

short cut:  "  <e  TAB  "
